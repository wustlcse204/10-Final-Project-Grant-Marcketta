Unfortunately, I think I was unprepared for the undertaking that Facebook API would be. 
I was reading old documents and did not realize that gathering Facebook group data required individual permissions that could take up to a week to process. 
Thus, I was forced to switch to the latter component of my proposal which is aggregating data. 
This assignment now gathers Reddit data for Super Smash Bros. using their API with the snoowrap wrapper.

More unfortunately, I encountered an error when displaying the JSON strings. I wanted each JSON string to show the Image and the Title from the top three Reddit
posts of each subreddit, but for some reason my React implementation was faulty. The JSON strings are shown in console to demonstrate that I at least properly
accessed the API. My apologies.
